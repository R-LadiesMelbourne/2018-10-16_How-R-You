```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(dplyr)
```

I'm not in Melbourne but I could not help entering it ðŸ˜…

My tip is thow to get all the functions within a package. Below you can find all the functions in `dplyr` (minus the internal hidden ones).
There are in total `r length(ls("package:dplyr"))` functions in `dplyr`. 
```{r, message=F, warning=F}
library(dplyr)
ls("package:dplyr")
```
